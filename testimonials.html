                <p>Harrold is a professional. He took pitures of our two dogs that got married, and he made it look like the greatest wedding since Kate and William, haha. Thanks Harrold!</p>

                <p>I'd be lying if I said Harold did a bad job at our recent company diner. Now the Boss is happy, so I'm happy. Book Harold NOW!</p>

                <p>I've known Harold since second grade and I had no idea he was this good. I didn't know he was a photographer til last year. Now my husband and I have Harolds photos hung in our luxurious tribeca home. Love you Harold, you make our life shine.</p>
